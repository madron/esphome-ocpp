# ESPHome OCPP Component

Component for controlling OCPP EV chargers from a local node.

The initial target protocol is **OCPP 1.6J**.

## Core Concepts

The configuration is organized around three electrical and OCPP concepts: the
site, chargers, and connectors. Each level has a different responsibility.

- The `site` describes the shared electrical installation. It defines the number
  of available phases, the phase-to-neutral voltage in `V`.
- A `charge_point` describes one OCPP charge point that connects to this component.
  It is identified by its `charge_point_id`, which must match the identity used
  by the charger in the WebSocket URL. Charger-level configuration is about
  admission, the number of phases, charger-to-site phase mapping, and grouping of
  the physical connectors belonging to that charge point.
- A `connector` describes one OCPP connector on a charger. It defines the OCPP
  connector ID, the connector's physical maximum current in `A`, and optionally
  its sensors, current-limit control, and restart/enable controls.

In short, the site owns shared electrical constraints, chargers represent OCPP
devices, and connectors represent the individually controlled charging outlets.

## Example Configuration

Example for a three-phase installation with one configured charger:

```yaml
ocpp:
  id: ocpp_id

  server:
    port: 9000

  charge_points:
    - id: garage_left
```

### Charger configuration

With the default server path `/`, configure the charger OCPP/WebSocket server URL as:
```text
ws://<esp-ip>:9000
```

### Units of Measure

- Power: Watts (`W`)
- Current: Amperes (`A`)
- Voltage: Volts (`V`)
- Energy: kilowatt-hours (`kWh`)
